CHEMBL1137491,"'Click resins' enable solid phase supported reactions to work under nearly perfect conditions fulfilling the requirements of click chemistry. Utilizing the formylpyrrolylmethyltriazole (FPMT) linker 6, which is readily available via copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), a BAL strategy could be successfully applied for a parallel synthesis of dopaminergic phenylacetylens. A focused library of 20 test compounds revealing three points of diversity was generated by a four-step SPOS approach including microwave assisted Sonogashira coupling. GPCR-ligand binding assays indicated excellent dopamine D3 and D4 receptor binding affinities which were identified to cause a partial agonist activity for the most potent test compounds 2c,e,i,k.","L?ber S, Gmeiner P, Rodriguez Loaiza P, H?bner H",,FALSE,10.1016/j.bmc.2007.08.038,7248,TRUE,23,Bioorg Med Chem,7257,1,,17827018,Click chemistry based solid phase supported synthesis of dopaminergic phenylacetylenes.,15,2008
CHEMBL1155082,"( S)-Glutamic acid (Glu) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) activating the plethora of ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs) and metabotropic Glu receptors (mGluRs). In this paper, we present a chemo-enzymatic strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of five new Glu analogues 2a- f ( 2d is exempt) holding a functionalized substituent in the 4-position. Nine Glu analogues 2a- j are characterized pharmacologically at native 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA), kainic acid (KA), and N-methyl- d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in rat synaptosomes as well as in binding assays at cloned rat iGluR5-7 subtypes. A detailed in silico study address as to why 2h is a high-affinity ligand at iGluR5-7 ( K i = 3.81, 123, 57.3 nM, respectively), while 2e is only a high affinity ligand at iGluR5 ( K i = 42.8 nM). Furthermore, a small series of commercially available iGluR ligands are characterized in iGluR5-7 binding.","Stensb?l TB, Nielsen B, Pu X, Chapelet M, Pickering DS, Sagot E, Bolte J, Gefflaut T, Bunch L, Umberti M",,FALSE,10.1021/jm800092x,4093,TRUE,14,J Med Chem,4103,8,7652,18578478,"Chemo-enzymatic synthesis of a series of 2,4-syn-functionalized (S)-glutamate analogues: new insight into the structure-activity relation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 5, 6, and 7.",51,2008
CHEMBL4000255,"(+)- and (-)-Lesinurad were isolated as atropisomers from racemic lesinurad for the first time. No interconversion was observed between the two atropisomers under various conditions tested. The two atropisomers showed significant differences in hURAT1 highly expressed HEK293 cell-based inhibition assays, monkey pharmacokinetic studies, and in vitro human recombinant CYP2C9 stability studies. It was speculated that (+)-lesinurad might offer a better hyperuricemia/gout therapy than (-)-lesinurad or the racemate.","Zeng W, Li J, Wang J, Gu Z, Li S, Chen S, Zhang Y, Shen L, Jia X",,FALSE,10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00465,299,TRUE,3,ACS Med Chem Lett,303,3,"200131, 214135",28337320,Discovery and Assessment of Atropisomers of (±)-Lesinurad.,8,2017
CHEMBL1145166,"(+)-2-Aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (1), also known as LY354740, is a highly potent and selective agonist for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors 2 and 3) tested in clinical trials. It has been shown to block anxiety in the fear-potentiated startle model. Its relatively low bioavailability in different animal species drove the need for an effective prodrug form that would produce a therapeutic response at lower doses for the treatment of anxiety disorders. We have investigated the increase of intestinal absorption of this compound by targeting the human peptide transporter hPepT1 for active transport of di- and tripeptides derived from 1. We have found that oral administration of an N dipeptide derivative of 1 (12a) in rats shows up to an 8-fold increase in drug absorption and a 300-fold increase in potency in the fear-potentiated startle model in rats when compared with the parent drug 1.","Mart?n LM, Pedregal C, de Dios A, Mart?n JA, Tabas LB, Dantzig AH, Tizzano JP, Montero C, Wright RA, Dom?nguez C, Stratford RE, Clay MP, Catlow J, Collado I, Lindstrom T, Jiang H, Mart?nez-Grau MA, Schoepp DD, Coffey DS, Monn JA, Bueno AB, Herin MF",0,FALSE,10.1021/jm050235r,5305,TRUE,16,J Med Chem,5320,7,46285,16078848,"Dipeptides as effective prodrugs of the unnatural amino acid (+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (LY354740), a selective group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist.",48,2005
CHEMBL2034878,"(+)-3a and (-)-3a were successfully separated from racemate (±)-3a by the chiral technique of supercritical fluid chromatography (SCF) with enantiomeric excess (ee%) >99% and purity >99%, and assigned for their absolute configuration as R and S, respectively, by the experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum and simulated ECD spectra calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. (+)-(R)-3a displayed excellent activity with an EC(50) of 5.3 nM against wild-type HIV-1, which was 12-fold more potent than (-)-(S)-3a. However, (-)-(S)-3a showed higher potency than (+)-(R)-3a against the double HIV-1 RT mutant (K103N+Y181C) as well as HIV-2 strain ROD. The possible reason for the difference of (R)- and (S)-3a in anti-HIV-1 activity was interpreted by molecular docking.","Ma XD, De Clercq E, Gu SX, Balzarini J, He QQ, Chen FE, Pannecouque C, Li ZM, Yang SQ",0,FALSE,10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.04.004,229,TRUE,,Eur J Med Chem,234,7,,22575532,"Chiral resolution, absolute configuration assignment and biological activity of racemic diarylpyrimidine CH(OH)-DAPY as potent nonnucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors.",53,2012
CHEMBL4118202,"(+)-Cyclazosin [(+)-1] is one of most selective antagonists of the ?1B-adrenoceptor subtype (selectivity ratios, ?1B/?1A?=?13, ?1B/?1D?=?38-39). To improve the selectivity, we synthesized and pharmacologically studied the blocking activity against ?1-adrenoceptors of several homochiral analogues of (+)-cyclazosin featuring different substituents on the carbonyl or amine groups, namely (-)-2, (+)-3, (-)-4-(-)-8, (+)-9. Moreover, we studied the activity of some their opposite enantiomers, namely (-)-1, (-)-3, (+)-6, and (-)-9, to evaluate the influence of stereochemistry on selectivity. The benzyloxycarbonyl and methyl (4aS,8aR) analogues (+)-3 and (-)-6 improved in a significant way the ?1B selectivity of the progenitor compound: 4 and 14 time vs. the ?1D subtype and 35 and 77 times vs. the ?1A subtype, respectively. The study confirmed the importance of the hydrophobic cis-octahydroquinoxaline moiety of these molecules for the establishment of interactions with the ?1-adrenoceptors as well that of their (4aS,8aR) stereochemistry to grant selectivity for the ?1B subtype. Hypotheses on the mode of interaction of these compounds were advanced on the basis of molecular modeling studies performed on compound (+)-3.","Buccioni M, Sagratini G, Skorski M, Marucci G, Poggesi E, Costanzi S, Giardin?

CHEMBL2331532,"(+)-Laburnamine (1), a rare alkaloid extracted from Laburnum anagyroides seeds (?4 mg from 1 kg), was shown to bind with high affinity (Ki, 293 nM) to the ?4?2 nicotinic receptor subtype, which is, respectively, 126 and 136 times higher than to the ?3?4 (Ki 37 ?M) and ?7 subtypes (Ki 40 ?M). When its ability to release [(3)H]-dopamine from striatal slices was tested in a functional assay, compound 1 behaved as a partial agonist with an EC50 of 5.8 ?M and an Emax that was 43% that of nicotine. When incubated with nicotine in the same assay, 1 prevented a maximal effect from being reached.","Sparatore F, Tasso B, Novelli F, Fasoli F, Gotti C",0,TRUE,10.1021/np3007028,727,TRUE,4,J Nat Prod,731,3,"I-20129, I-16132",23461628,"(+)-Laburnamine, a natural selective ligand and partial agonist for the ?4?2 nicotinic receptor subtype.",76,2013
