Moreover, we studied the activity of some their opposite enantiomers, namely (-)-1, (-)-3, (+)-6, and (-)-9, to evaluate the influence of stereochemistry on selectivity. The benzyloxycarbonyl and methyl (4aS,8aR) analogues (+)-3 and (-)-6 improved in a significant way the α1B selectivity of the progenitor compound: 4 and 14 time vs. the α1D subtype and 35 and 77 times vs. the α1A subtype, respectively. The study confirmed the importance of the hydrophobic cis-octahydroquinoxaline moiety of these molecules for the establishment of interactions with the α1-adrenoceptors as well that of their (4aS,8aR) stereochemistry to grant selectivity for the α1B subtype.
